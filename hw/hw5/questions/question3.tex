\section{Question 3}
\subsection{(a)}
In order to prove that $B \in \text{NP}$, we need to show that it is verifiable with a given certificate.
The certificate for this question should have the following language:
\[\text{certificate}=\{\langle C, W, V \rangle : C = \text{a subset of } S, \hspace{5mm} W,V \in \mathbb{R}\}\]
We can see that this certificate is in polynomial-size as it has $n$ elements. Given this certificate, we can go through the subset, calculate the sum of weights and values and compare them with $W$ and $V$ to
check whether they meet the requirement or not. This simple algorithm has time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n)$ which means
this problem is verifiable in polynomial-time, thus an NP. 
\subsection{(b)}
For showing that $A \leq_P B$, we need a polynomial-time function that transform a problem in $A$ language to $B$ language.
This way we can show that $B$ is at least as hard as $A$. Given a set $S$ and target $k$ such that there is subset $C \subseteq S$ with sum
of values equal to $k$, we can construct our \textsc{Knapsack} language as:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \textsc{Knapsack}=\{\langle S', W, V \rangle : & S' = \text{a set with elements } S'_i \text{ as } (w_i, v_i) \text{ where } w_i=v_i=S_i, \\
        & W=V=k\}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
In other words, we set the elements of $S$ for both the weights and values of $S'$ and set $k$ for both $W$ and $V$. This reduction function is in polynomial-time
as it has to go over the set $S$ once (time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n)$). In order to show that our function works, we have to prove that
$\langle S, k \rangle \in \textsc{Subset Sum}$ if and only if $\langle S', W, V \rangle \in \textsc{Knapsack}$: \\

\textbf{Equivalence Proof:} Suppose $\exists C \subseteq S$ such that $\sum C = k$. Then, by setting $S'$ with weights and values in the same order of $S$ and the targets of them equal to $k$, there will be a 
$C' \subseteq S'$ such that $\sum_{C'}w_i=k\leq W$ and $\sum_{C'}v_i=k\geq V$.

Now suppose $\exists C' \subseteq S'$ such that $\sum_{C'}w_i\leq W$ and $\sum_{C'}v_i\geq V$. Note that the weights and values of every element in $S'$ is the same and $V=W$. Thus, we can say that
the list of weights is exactly the same as the list of values in $C'$. Since $V=W$, the only way that the sum of this list can be at most $W$ and at least $V$ is if it would be equal to them. By setting
a new set $S$ as $S_i=v_i \text{ or } w_i$, there would be a subset $C \subseteq S$ such that $\sum C=V=W=k$. \\

Now that we have proved $B \in \text{NP}$ and $A \leq_P B$, we can conclude that the \textsc{Knapsack} problem is NP-Complete.

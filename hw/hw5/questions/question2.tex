\section{Question 2}
\subsection{(a)}
Given two graphs $G_1 = (V_1, E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$, the form of the certificate is 
n pairs of vertices $v_1 \in V_1$ and $v_2 \in V_2$ and m pairs of edges $e_1 \in E_1$ and $e_2 \in E_2$ representing the common subgraph and an integer k.
The verification algorithm first affirms that the number of edge pairs is greater than k.
Next, for each pair of edges $(u_1, v_1)$ and $(u_2, v_2)$, the verifcation algorithm checks that $(u_1, u_2)$ and $(v_1, v_2)$ are pairs in the set of vertices.
The worst case runtime for this algorithm means that for each edge pair, every vertex pair needs to be traversed making the time complexity $\mathcal{O}(VE)$
where V and E represent the maximum size between $G_1$ and $G_2$ of their vertices and edges respectivly.
Therefore, we can verify the certificate in polynomial time.
